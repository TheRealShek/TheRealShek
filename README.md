## 🔭 About Me
- 💡 DevOps enthusiast who believes **scalable & secure automation** is the answer (what was the question again?)
- 🧠 Currently learning to speak **Golang** (since mid-2025) — building CLI tools to explore concurrency & reliability, and trying not to summon Cthulhu with goroutines
- ⚙️ Experienced with **infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines (my therapists), and observability systems** (because someone has to watch the watchers)

## 🛠 Tech I Wrangle
Here's the stack I use to build, break, and then automate the fixing process.

- **Cloud & Infra:** `Terraform` to build things, `Kubernetes` to orchestrate the chaos, and `AWS` to send the bills.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** `GitHub Actions` and `ArgoCD` are my loyal robots. `Jenkins` is the grumpy old butler who, surprisingly, still gets the job done.
- **Languages:** Currently sweet-talking `Go`. I also argue with the TypeScript compiler daily, and sometimes it even lets me win.

## 🚀 Featured Project — **ATHENA** (My Pet AI, almost)
**ATHENA** — *A Golang-based toolkit for automating API test generation (Keploy-inspired MVP). Because manual testing is for mere mortals.*
- CLI: `record` / `replay` for HTTP traffic (like a digital eavesdropper)
- Smart diff engine (it knows when to ignore your messy transient fields)
- Local YAML/JSON storage (because who needs databases when you have files?)
- Stack: Go · Cobra · net/http · httptest (the usual suspects)
